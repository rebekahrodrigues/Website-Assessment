1.1.1 Background
The problem that I am attempting to solve through my website is self promotion. As promoting one's self through a CV could be a complex problem. Hence, I believe that promoting oneself on a website could be helpful because it will help me to target and interact with companies online. I also beieve that it is better for me to have an online website rather than a traditional handwritten CV because it will help me to look for IT jobs more easily.

1.1.2 Wireframes
On Powerpoint presentation.

1.1.3 Colour Choices
The font colour that I used for the text on my website is black. The reason for this is because black makes it easy for the user to read the content along with making it look professional. For the background of my webpages I have selected the colour grey because it gives the webpages a very formal and sophisticated finish making the website look neat and professional. 

1.1.4 Accessibility
To make my website more accessible for the audience, I have added alternative text for all the images that I have used on my webpages. As without alt text, an image does not have a lot of meaning for people who cannot see and use a screen reader to read. Hence I made sure that I used alt text for all the images because the alt text information will be useful for people who are blind, as well as to people who turn off the images by letting them have an idea of what exactly the image contains or potrays.

1.2.7 Evaluation
Overall, I have made sure that my website looks presentable and professional along with meeting all the critieria that was instructed in the assignment brief. By creating a website on my CV, it helped me to tackle the problem which was self promotion. It helped me to be more confident and showcase myself better compared to before creating the website because it really pushed me out of my comfort-zone in order to come up with aspects related to myself. However, there were a few problems along the way, the main problem that I faced was the background image. Once I applied the picture to my website, the image streched itself and looked very unprofessional. Hence to solve the problem, I found a very high-quality picture that would relate to my website that wouldn't lose it's original quality and not be too pixelated. I tested my website on different devices such as my mobile phone and my iPAD in order to see if the quality of the content is the same as what it looks like on my laptop. I also, found out that my breakpoints were working perfectly as intended because the content would shift in order to fit the screen of my iPAD. My website design choices were based on a self promotion website that I came across which I researched before creating my website.
